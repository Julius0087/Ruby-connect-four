# Ruby-connect-four
A Ruby script for a game of connect four played in the terminal
## Description
This is a project for TOP Ruby course, a game of connect-four played in the terminal. The game is played by running script.rb and proceeding to choose names and colors for each player.
Players then take turns to drop tokens into columns with a goal of connecting four tokens of their color (verticaly, horizontaly or diagonaly). Players take turns until one of them wins or the columns are all full.
The goal of this project was to practice TDD with Rspec.
## Thoughts
Implementing the game itself was fun, but the testing part was difficult. I struggled to stick to TDD principles and often broke them, writing the code first and tests second.
The tests don't feel meaningful (though they work) and I sometimes wasn't sure if I was testing the right thing. This is definitely an area I can improve on.
